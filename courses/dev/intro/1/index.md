## Introduction

Web development is a great skill to have. As a starter, web-related jobs are always in high demand, and having these skills can 
expand your career opportunities. Even if you don't plan to do web development professionally, it is a nice hobby to do in your spare time.  

This tutorial series is aimed towards people that want to learn web dev but have little or no prior experience. 
What makes this series unique is how we present the materials. 

In the modern day, the internet has bought us an abundance of information - sometimes too much information. If you Google terms like "Web development tutorial",
you will likely be presented with a barrage of websites, blogs, pots, and videos about various topics related to web dev. Especially for begineers this may appear intimidating and 
make it hard to get a kickstart.  

Instead, this series will guide you through, step-by-step, the entire process and field of web dev. We will intentionally leave out some details, especially 
when covering topics like HTML, and put more focus on concepts. The idea is that this will help you grasp the bigger picture easier, and <i>then</i> you can start 
Googling more specific topics on your own as you gain footing. 


Also through the series, we will be making a single webpage that displays "Hello World". As you will see, even a simple page like this often requires great work to get running.
