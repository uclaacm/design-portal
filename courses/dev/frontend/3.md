For this prompt, create a file called `temp.html`

## Define your website
Before populating the website with content, we need to define attributes 
for the webiste, like its name and description.


Add the following tags to your `temp.html`:

- `<!doctype>`
- `<html>`
- `<head>`
- `<body>`
- `<title>`


For the title tag, you can put any title you want. See if you can find where the title will be displayed.

In addition, add several `meta` tags to specify the following attributes of your website:

- description
- keywords
- viewport

## Populate the website

Now with the framework done, we can finally start adding content. To introduce you to 
as much HTML as possible, the specs will require some rare tags and attributes - if you want, you can delete these after you have submitted this prompt.

You may notice that the specs say nothing about layout and styling - we will save that for later,
when we dive into CSS. In fact, you are not allowed to use CSS at all for this prompt.

First, create an image. It can be any picture, as long as we can see it. Set its attributes so the width is 300px.

Write a single sentence of your choice. The sentence must meet the following specs:

- The first word is italicized
- The second wrod is bolded
- The third word is "&lt;tag&gt;"
- When you hover over the text with your mouse, you see a popup that says "Hello There"

Write the word "top" 5 times. Each word must be contained within its own tag 
(i.e. you cannot just write `<p>TopTopTopTopTop</p>`). 

Use appropriate tags so they are displayed on top of each other  

Write the word "side" 5 times. Each word must be contained within its own tag. Use appropriate tags so they are displayed next to each other.
