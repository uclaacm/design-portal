First off, make sure you have all of the neccesary tools installed. 
Even if you have them, it is a good idea to update them now:

Go back to your local repo, **switch to dev branch**, and run `npm init`
You can answer yes to all questions. This will generate a file called package.js, which tells npm that 
this folder is a project which will require various programs and tools to run. package.js 
contains the name and version of those required program, as well as other settings for your project.


Now run `npm install --save-dev @11ty/eleventy`


This will install 11ty and record in package.js that this project requires 11ty to work.

Now, to the prompt. First create a directory called `_includes`. Create a file called 
`default.njk` in the directory. 
Files in the _include directory can be used as templates to speed up your development process. There are may things you can do with templates, but for now 
we will stick with a simple example.
Paste the following code into default.njk:


```

<h1>
    {% raw %} {{ content | safe }} {% endraw %}
</h1>

```
where `{% raw %}{{ content | safe }}{% endraw %}` will be replaced with the content of the webpage that uses this template. Now in the root directory, create a file called index.html and paste in the following code:
               
```

```

After you are done, use the following commands to run 11ty and convert the files you wrote into the final website.

```

# Run 11ty and build files into the final website.
# The generated website is stored in _site
npx @11ty/eleventy

# Run a local server to test your website
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve 

```

<!--<p>Read the following tutorial on package file scripts:</p>

<div class="links">
{{ m.link("https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/introduction-to-npm-scripts-1dbb2ae01633/",              "freecodecamp.org",    "Introduction to NPM Scripts" ) }}
</div>


<p>Modify your <span>package.js</span> file so all you need to type is <span>npm run build</span> 
to build your website with 11ty, and <span>npm run serve</span> to run the local test server. </p>

<p>This is an important step to make sure your website shows correctly on ZEIT. 
Without this step, ZEIT will not know how to convert your njk files into a proper website using HTML. 
</p>

<p>
Once you are done, run <span>npm run build</span> and <span>npm run serve</span> to make sure it works as intended.
</p>

<p>
Next, push your code to GitHub, and check ZEIT to see if the website dpeloyed correctly. ZEIT is smart enough to automatically
run the <span>build</span> script you just made, automatically extract the final website saved in <span>_site</span>, and display it as a website 
for all to see.                 
</p>

<p>
But just as a good practice, we will explicitly tell ZEIT how it should build and deploy our website. This is actually very easy. 
Go to your project's setting âž¡ General âž¡ Build and Development Setting, and set Framework Preset to "Eleventy". Hit save. 
Now, any time you push your 11ty project to GitHub, it will automatically build and deploy to ZEITðŸŽŠ.
