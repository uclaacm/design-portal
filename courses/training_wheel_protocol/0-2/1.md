- Websites usually run a programming language called JavaScript.
- But JavaScript only runs in web browsers (like Google Chrome) - you can't run them on your computer like Python or C.
- People were like "Hey won't it be nice if we can run Js on our computer like other languages"
- So people made a software that can run Js on you computer => node.js
- "Awsome now we can program bunch of cool software and tools using Js and run it on our computer"

- "Hmm won't it be nice if we basically had an app store where people can share their Js programs" => npm

As for ZEIT, for now just know its a place where we can save our website, so anyone in the world can access it anytime.
