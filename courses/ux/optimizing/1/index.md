In this series, we will examine this sample website mockup:

{{ m.img( "1.png", "") }}

This website implements most UX concepts introduced in the previous section. However, if one were to ask, “is this a cool website?”, the answer will probably be mixed. Aside from miscellaneous factors like color, this website has several issues that make it unappealing. 

In this series, we will visit several topics needed to polish up this website further. This series in particular focuses on desktop websites for typical organizations (like ACM at UCLA), but many of the concepts are applicable to other mediums like posters and mobile apps.
