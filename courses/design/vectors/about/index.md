This series is designed to teach the basics of graphic design using Figma. 

We will start off by creating a simple slab:

{{ m.img( "slab.png", "") }}

Using this as a starting point, you will learn basics of lighting and color, as well as some tips and tricks to make convincing vector graphics efficiently. Ultimately, you will be creating complex graphics, like this crane:

{{ m.img( "crane.png", "") }}
